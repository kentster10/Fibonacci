one of the questions for your role.

# Software, Product, and Embedded Engineering Candidates

In the programming language of your choice, write a program 
generating the first n Fibonacci numbers F(n), printing ...
- ... "Buzz" when F(n) is divisible by 3.
- ... "Fizz" when F(n) is divisible by 5.
- ... "BuzzFizz" when F(n) is prime.
- ... the value F(n) otherwise.

Bonus points for efficient implementation, testing, documentation, 
and/or upload your code to GitHub.

# Estimation Candidates

How do you test decide whether a given set of real-valued
observations are drawn from a Gaussian distribution? Given a
streaming time series of real-valued, scalar observations,
describe an online algorithm for determining a linear Gaussian
model of these observations as a function of time step.

# GNSS Candidates

Explain, briefly, the main error terms contributing to
positioning error in GPS satellite navigation. How are these
eliminated in differential GPS? What error sources remain?
