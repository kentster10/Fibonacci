%{
In the programming language of your choice, write a program 
generating the first n Fibonacci numbers F(n), printing ...
- ... "Buzz" when F(n) is divisible by 3.
- ... "Fizz" when F(n) is divisible by 5.
- ... "BuzzFizz" when F(n) is prime.
- ... the value F(n) otherwise.

Bonus points for efficient implementation, testing, documentation, 
and/or upload your code to GitHub.

F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

function fibonacci_Test

obj = fibonacci();
obj.main();
